<p><span>Derby</span> application developers use JDBC, the application programming interface
that makes it possible to access relational databases from Java programs.
The JDBC API is part of the Javaâ„¢ 2 Platform, Standard Edition and is
not specific to <span>Derby</span>. It consists of the <em>java.sql</em> and <em>javax.sql</em> packages,
which is a set of classes and interfaces that make it possible to access databases
(from a number of different vendors, not just <span>Derby</span>) from a Java
application.</p>

<p>To develop <span>Derby</span> applications successfully, you will need to learn JDBC.
This section does not teach you how to program with the JDBC API.</p>

<p>This section covers the details of application programming that are specific
to <span>Derby</span> applications. For example, all JDBC applications typically start
their DBMS's JDBC driver and use a connection URL to connect to a database.
This chapter gives you the details of how to start <span>Derby</span>'s JDBC driver and
how to work with <span>Derby</span>'s connection URL to accomplish various tasks. It also
covers essential <span>Derby</span> concepts such as the <span>Derby</span> system.</p>

<p>You will find reference information about the particulars of <span>Derby</span>'s implementation
of JDBC in the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>. </p>

<p><span>Derby</span> application developers will need to learn SQL. <em>SQL</em> is the
standard query language used with relational databases and is not tied to
a particular programming language. No matter how a particular RDBMS has been
implemented, the user can design databases and insert, modify, and retrieve
data using the standard SQL statements and well-defined data types. SQL-92
is the version of SQL standardized by ANSI and ISO in 1992; <span>Derby</span> supports
entry-level SQL-92 as well as some higher-level features. Entry-level SQL-92
is a subset of full SQL-92 specified by ANSI and ISO that is supported by
nearly all major DBMSs today. This chapter does not teach you SQL. You will
find reference information about the particulars of <span>Derby</span>'s implementation
of SQL in the <cite><span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span></cite>.</p>

<p><span>Derby</span> implements JDBC that allows <span>Derby</span> to serve a resource manager in
a J2EE compliant system.</p>
